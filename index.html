### Developed by DuckDev

A Link Between Ages is not a reboot nor a remake: it's a complete new game, based in the world and premise of A link to the Past, 
that preserves the spirit of the original game, but with a new gameplay and plot.
 This is the Alpha release: all the in-game content is implemented.

Link has a quiet life in the Kakariko village. One day, the princess Zelda goes to the western forest, and Link follows her...


The game is meant to be played with Game Controller. However, there are keyboard debug controls that you can use to explore the game.
Be careful! These keyboard controls are not polished and there are missing features, since they are not intended to be in the final game. 

Controls (gamepad):
- Left joystick: move
- ABXY: attack/talk with NPC/open chests
- Right bumper: dodge
- Left bumper: change between inventory items
- Left Trigger: use equipped item (hold it and press ABXY to use the bow and the bomb sac)
- Right Trigger: use Spin Attack (you need a special book to learn this movement)
- Start: Open pause menu

Controls (keyboard):
- WASD: move
- Directional arrows: attack/talk with NPC/open chests
- Spacebar: dodge
- ESC: open menu
- Intro: skip cutscene text
- V: spawn arrow
- B: spawn bomb

DEBUG HACK: press F2 to skip to the final battle.
