 A Link Between Ages is a 2D adventure-action game, developed by DuckDev, a student-based dev team hosted by the Polytecnical University of Cataluña (Spain), and built as a tribute to the well-known franchise The Legend Of Zelda and, more accurately, to the second game: A Link To the Past.   
  A Link Between Ages is a brand new game with brand new gameplay, taking inspiration of rogue-like games such as The Binding of Isaac.
  Expect speed-up gameplay and an action-centered game.   
  Hope you enjoy it!
