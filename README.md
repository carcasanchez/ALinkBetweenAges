### Developed by DuckDev

A Link Between Ages is not a reboot nor a remake: it's a complete new game, based in the world and premise of A link to the Past, 
that preserves the spirit of the original game, but with a new gameplay and plot.
 This is the Alpha release: all the in-game content is implemented.

Link has a quiet life in the Kakariko village. One day, the princess Zelda goes to the western forest, and Link follows her...
