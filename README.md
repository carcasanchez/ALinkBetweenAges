 The central piece of our game is the sword based, agile combat. The player has full control of the direction of his or her attacks, and the ability to make a quick dodge movement.   
 But be careful! Dodging and attacking consumes stamina, and you can't do them if you are low! Stamina recharges automatically when you are not doing any of those actions.   
 
 <h2>Exploration</h2>
