 A Link Between Ages is a 2D adventure-action game, developed by DuckDev, a student-based dev team hosted by the Polytecnical University of Cataluña (Spain), and built as a tribute to the well-known franchise The Legend Of Zelda and, more accurately, to the second game: A Link To the Past.   
  A Link Between Ages is a brand new game with brand new gameplay, taking inspiration of rogue-like games such as The Binding of Isaac.
  Expect speedy gameplay and an action-centered game.   
  
  Hope you enjoy it!

    As said, A Link Between Ages is a action-adventure, top-view game. Gameplay its similar to the classic Zelda games, but with special emphasis on battles.  
    *Gamepad recommended*
    
<h2>Combat </h2>

 The central piece of our game is the sword based, agile combat. The player has full control of the direction of his or her attacks, and the ability to make a quick dodge movement.   
 But be careful! Dodging and attacking consumes stamina, and you can't do them if you are low! Stamina recharges automatically when you are not doing any of those actions.   
 
 <h2>Exploration</h2>
