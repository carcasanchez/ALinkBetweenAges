 A Link Between Ages is a 2D adventure-action game, developed by DuckDev, a student-based dev team hosted by the Polytecnical University of Cataluña (Spain), and built as a tribute to the well-known franchise The Legend Of Zelda and, more accurately, to the second game: A Link To the Past.   
  A Link Between Ages is a brand new game with brand new gameplay, taking inspiration of rogue-like games such as The Binding of Isaac.
  Expect speed-up gameplay and an action-centered game.   
  Hope you enjoy it!

<h2> Carlos Cabreira - Team Leader and gameplay programmer </h2>
  
   Hi. I'm the former leader of the DuckDev team and I have been working in everything related to gameplay programming, being that: 
   * Player movement
   * Collisions System
   * Enemy IA
   * Entity system and functionality (items and npc's)
   
   Also, I have created the Quest Manager System that we used to track events inside the game. You can check [its documentation page](https://carcasanchez.github.io/QuestManager/) to see how it works. It includes a step by step tutorial if you want to apply it to your project.
