# A Link Between Ages

### Developed by DuckDev

A Link Between Ages is not a reboot nor a remake: it's a complete new game, based in the world and premise of A link to the Past, 
that preserves the spirit of the original game, but with a new gameplay and plot. In our v0.4 you can check out four different
maps, them being Kakariko Village and its forest, and Kakariko's Castle both inside and outside.

Get rid of all the soldiers to win!!! You have three lives to succeed, if not, you'll start again. But be aware, 
actions consume stamina, use it carefully.

Tip: talk to the NPCs to know where the evil soldiers are hiding!
